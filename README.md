👋 Hello! I'm Mustafa Can Ayter, a data scientist and linguist based in Chicago. With expertise in data science and linguistics, I specialize in leveraging advanced techniques to extract insights and drive decision-making.

🌟 My skills include Python, SQL, machine learning, data visualization, and linguistic analysis. I hold a Master's in Central Eurasian Studies from Indiana University, a Bachelor's in Linguistics from Hacettepe University in Turkey, and completed a Data Science and Visualization Boot Camp at Northwestern University.

💼 As a linguist at KACE Company, I provided simultaneous translation and localization services for law enforcement. At Indiana University, I conducted linguistic examinations, analyzed speech datasets, and taught graduate courses.

🚀  In the realm of data science, I have collaborated on several impactful projects:
- **MADAIN**: Developed a machine learning model to predict skin cancer using CNNs. Contributed to testing, benchmarking, and deployment.
- **Effects of Climate Variability on Wine Production Metrics**: Created a Pandas database, applied data cleaning and integration, conducted statistical analysis, and created visualizations.
- **Geospatial Visualization of Volcanic Activity**: Created a SQL database, leveraged dynamic maps to present volcanic activity data, incorporated interactive objects, and enhanced user engagement.

🔬 My research includes my master's thesis, "Towards Accounting for L2 Accent - The Case of Turkish Vowel Space," on collecting, structuring, and analyzing data on speech variables second language acquisition and phonetics.

🌐 I am passionate about collaborating with fellow data scientists and linguists to tackle challenges and drive innovation. Let's connect on LinkedIn or explore my projects on GitHub to work together and make an impact in data science and linguistics.
