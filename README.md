üëã Hello! I'm Mustafa Can Ayter, a data scientist and linguist based in Chicago. With a unique blend of expertise in data science and linguistics, I specialize in leveraging advanced techniques to extract valuable insights and drive data-driven decision-making.

üåü My skills encompass programming languages such as Python and SQL, machine learning algorithms, data visualization tools, and a deep understanding of linguistic analysis. I hold a Master's degree in Central Eurasian Studies from Indiana University and a Bachelor's degree in Linguistics from Hacettepe University in Turkey. I have also completed a rigorous Data Science and Visualization Boot Camp at Northwestern University.

üíº Throughout my professional journey, I have made significant contributions in both data science and linguistics. As a linguist at KACE Company, I provided critical simultaneous translation services for law enforcement agencies. In my role as a graduate assistant at Indiana University, I designed and conducted linguistic examinations, analyzing speech datasets to uncover valuable insights. I also developed and taught graduate-level linguistics courses. In the realm of data science, I have spearheaded projects such as MADAIN (Mole Analysis with Deep Adam-Optimized Inception Network), where I developed a cutting-edge machine learning model to predict skin cancer using CNN architectures. My research endeavors include my master's thesis, "Towards Accounting for L2 Accent - The Case of Turkish Vowel Space," which involved designing and conducting research on second language acquisition and phonetics.

üåê I am passionate about collaborating with fellow data scientists, linguists, and researchers to tackle challenging problems and drive innovation. If you would like to connect, discuss potential collaborations, or learn more about my work, please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or explore my projects here on GitHub. I look forward to the opportunity to work together and make a meaningful impact in the fields of data science and linguistics.
