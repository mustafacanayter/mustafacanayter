üëã Hello! I'm Mustafa Can Ayter, a data scientist and linguist based in Chicago. With a unique blend of expertise in data science and linguistics, I specialize in leveraging advanced techniques to extract valuable insights and drive data-driven decision-making.

üåü My skills encompass programming languages such as Python and SQL, machine learning algorithms, data visualization tools, and a deep understanding of linguistic analysis. I hold a Master's degree in Central Eurasian Studies from Indiana University and a Bachelor's degree in Linguistics from Hacettepe University in Turkey. I have also completed a rigorous Data Science and Visualization Boot Camp at Northwestern University.

üíº Throughout my professional journey, I have made significant contributions in both data science and linguistics. As a linguist at KACE Company, I provided critical simultaneous translation services for law enforcement agencies. In my role as a graduate assistant at Indiana University, I designed and conducted linguistic examinations, analyzing speech datasets to uncover valuable insights. I also developed and taught graduate-level linguistics courses.

üöÄ In the realm of data science, I have collaborated on several impactful projects. One notable project is MADAIN (Mole Analysis with Deep Adam-Optimized Inception Network), where our team developed a cutting-edge machine learning model to predict skin cancer using CNN architectures. I contributed to the project by conducting extensive testing and benchmarking, and actively participated in planning the deployment via a web app. Another project, "Examining the Effects of Climate Variability on Viticulture Production Metrics," involved creating a Pandas database with collected data on global wine production and historical temperature. As part of the team, I applied data cleaning and integration techniques using Pandas, ensuring high data quality and uniformity. Through collaborative efforts in statistical analysis with SciPy stats, we secured data integrity and accuracy. Leveraging Matplotlib and Seaborn, I worked alongside my teammates to create insightful visualizations that effectively communicated the findings. Additionally, I was part of a team that developed "A Dynamic Geospatial Visualization of Volcanism," an interactive web-based platform that visualizes volcanic activity worldwide. My contributions included creating a SQL database in PostgreSQL to manage and store refined data. Collaborating with my teammates, we leveraged Folium and Ipyleaflet dynamic maps to present geographical and seismological data on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), casualties, and economic damages associated with volcanic events. Through joint efforts, we incorporated interactive objects with JavaScript, enabling seamless navigation between different data visualizations and enhancing user engagement. The platform also features an MP4 video as the background, adding an immersive element to the user experience.

üî¨ My research endeavors include my master's thesis, "Towards Accounting for L2 Accent - The Case of Turkish Vowel Space," which involved designing and conducting research on second language acquisition and phonetics.

üåê I am passionate about collaborating with fellow data scientists, linguists, and researchers to tackle challenging problems and drive innovation. If you would like to connect, discuss potential collaborations, or learn more about my work, please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or explore my projects here on GitHub. I look forward to the opportunity to work together and make a meaningful impact in the fields of data science and linguistics.
