Data scientist with background in linguistics, leveraging computational linguistics and data analysis to narrate deep insights. Proficient in Python, SQL, and regex for data handling and analysis. Experienced in machine learning models, data visualization with Tableau and JavaScript, and research coordination.

Highlights of Work on Data Science:
- **MADAIN - Mole Analysis with Deep Adam-Optimized Inception Network**: We've developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the InceptionV3 architecture with the Adam optimizer, aiming to classify skin lesions into one of seven categories, prioritizing recall for cancerous classes to minimize false negatives. After benchmarking multiple CNN architectures and optimizers, and running extensive tests including adjusting epochs, custom weight schemes, and implementing both multiclass and binary classifiers, our model has been integrated into a web app showcased on GitHub pages. Our dataset, sourced from Kaggle, features 10,015 images. Despite challenges like class imbalance, our ongoing efforts include fine-tuning through increased neuron density, inverse proportional weighting, and experimental augmented image training to improve classification accuracy and recall rates, particularly for underrepresented classes.
- **Effects of Climate Variability on Wine Production Metrics**: Created a Pandas database, applied data cleaning and integration, conducted statistical analysis, and created visualizations.
- **Geospatial Visualization of Volcanic Activity**: Created a SQL database, leveraged dynamic maps to present volcanic activity data, incorporated interactive objects, and enhanced user engagement.

Highlights of Work on Linguistics:
- **Towards Accounting for L2 Accent - The Case of Turkish Vowel Space**: Collecting, structuring, and analyzing human speech data on the basis of second language acquisition and phonetics.

I am excited about collaborating with fellow data scientists and linguists to tackle challenges and drive innovation. Let's connect on LinkedIn or explore my projects on GitHub to work together and make an impact in data science and linguistics.
